Vagrant and Ansible both had some learning curves associated with each technology.


Vagrant:

For starters, the use of Ruby as the primary scripting language threw me into an unfamiliar syntax.
Fortunately the commands are fairly straight forward to read, however it would have been significantly more challenging without some scaffolding/template to build on.
Had the Vagrant script file been a flavor of Python or yaml, I feel I would have been able to compose and possibly abstract/encapsulate and group functionality better.
The other issue I had dealing with the vagrant file was transfering of stastic playbooks to arbitrary locations and running on the remote host.
To solve this, I kept the file paths simple to ensure consistency.
Overall, vagrant was pretty useful, but does feel a bit older than say Ansible in its design.


Ansible:

Yaml - Yaml Ain't Markup Language has become increasingly popular for a declarative manifest of sorts.
Ansible's use of yaml in playbooks leads to concise, and direct commands to execute to different inventory groups.
So far its been pretty nice and easy to work with.
